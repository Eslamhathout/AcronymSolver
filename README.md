# AcronymSolver
It searches google for acronyms such as CEO, etc.


It's a function to solve the acronyms such as CEO, CTO, ect. It uses google to search the pages for the word, then extract the pattern that fit the acronym out of the page name and description, then return the most common solution out of all the searched pages.

This is build on the python search google api which explained here https://github.com/BirdAPI/Google-Search-API.
